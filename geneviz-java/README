Welcome to Openchart2 Charting and Plotting Library
from Approximatrix, LLC

Introduction 
------------ 

Openchart2 is a collection of Java classes to provide rendering of a
variety of 2D charts/plots. The library is licensed under the GNU Lesser
General Public License, which allows the library to be included in
closed-source and proprietary projects as long as the library code
remains unchanged.  Further documentation of the library, including more
general documentation and usage instructions, is available from the
Openchart2 page at Approximatrix.  All Openchart2 documentation is
freely available.

Supported Chart Types
---------------------

Openchart2 supports a variety of 2D charts, as shown below:

   1. Bar Charts (including Stacked Bar Charts)
   2. Pie Charts
   3. Radar Charts
   4. Scatter Plots (including Line Charts, Point Charts, or a combination)
   5. Dot Plots

Furthermore, the rendering system used by Openchart2 allows multiple
chart types to be rendered simultaneously in the same view.

Supported Data Sources/Models
-----------------------------

Openchart2 can handle a variety of data sources, although the chart
types may place restrictions on the allowed data.  Nominally, Openchart2
can handle any number of data arrays through its ChartDataModel classes. 
Specialized data models are available for database sources and scatter
plots.

Dependencies
------------

Openchart2 depends only on a working Java 1.5-compliant (or better) VM and 
runtime library.  No other external dependencies exist.
